### General Info

This is day 1 of the challange. I build a cool displaying effect using flexbox, and simple JavaScript. This project showed me that I gave not been using the "flex" property enough on my flex items. It gives you more control on your flex items, and you can create some really cool transition effects to them. I did not learn anything new on the Javascript side, but it was good practice.
